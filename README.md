What are the Most Important Statistical Ideas of the Past 50 Years? 

The paper "What are the Most Important Statistical Ideas of the Past 50 Years?" by Andrew Gelman and Aki Vehtari reviews several statistical concepts that have transformed the field over the past half-century. These include: counterfactual causal inference,  bootstrapping and simulation-based inference, overparameterized models and regularization, bayesian multilevel models, generic computation algorithms, adaptive decision analysis, robust inference, and exploratory data analysis. The paper discusses how these ideas lead to methods and workflows, advances in computing, big data, and the connections between these statistical ideas. The paper highlights theory and computation in the advancement of these concepts, and anticipates future developments in statistics.
